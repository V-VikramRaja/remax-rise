            About RE/MAX <span>RISE</span>
          </h1>
          <p>
            Sashi Yarramsetti and business partner Madhava Dudipalli opened
            RE/MAX Rise in May 2023 with a goal to meet the local communityâ€™s
            real estate needs, help people realise their home ownership goals,
            and be recognised for delivering a truly exceptional real estate
            experience covering all aspects of the process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sashi and Madhavaâ€™s point of difference is in the merging of their
            skill sets, their expertise and knowledge. Property investment, real
            estate sales transactions and property management, finance and
            business acumen are in their pedigree.
          </p>
          <p>
            They have grown a solid client base and investor network bringing
            repeat and referral business since joining RE/MAX as sales agents,
            and now the property and finance experiences of these business
            leaders translates into great real estate experiences for their
            RE/MAX Rise customers and clients. Their passion for real estate is
            matched by a deep commitment to the local community, where both are
            actively involved.
          </p>
          <p>
            Located at Ripley, RE/MAX Rise provides high-quality real estate
            services to the vibrant and rapidly growing community and its
            surrounding Ipswich suburbs, while being part of the largest real
